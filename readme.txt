This folder contains my code submission for my thesis:
Static Analysis of Embedded Visual Basicfor Applications for Malware Detection 
by Mohamed Reda Arsalane

I did not include the data in this repository because privacy reasons.

In order to run the project you will need to run the following command to install all the dependencies:
pip install requirements.txt

I implemented 3 feature extraction methods that can be found in Extraction.py 
It uses function from Code_analysis.py where I implemented most of the feature extraction from the VBA dataset.

I implemented 4 classifiers from sickit learn they can be found in Models.py.
2 other classifiers were implemented using TensorFlow 2 Keras they can be found in Run_Models.ipynb.

All the models can be trained and evaluated from Run_Models.ipynb.
In order to execute any model you will first have to run the the first 2 cells
to read the data and Import all the needed functions.

The Dataset provided by Acronis in is not included in this submission.
The Data folder contains the feature extracted from the dataset as well as some files used in the testing phase.
